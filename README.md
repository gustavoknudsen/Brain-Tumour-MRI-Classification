# Brain Tumor Classification Analysis NN vs. CNN

## Overview
- Investigation Comparing the Results of a Traditional Neural Network vs. a Convolutional Neural Network in Image Classification Tasks.
- Brain Tumor MRI Dataset by Masoud Nickparvar: [[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)]

## Key Findings
- Validation Accuracy: 94.4% vs. 67.8%
- Model Architecture: Custom CNN (inspired by VGG)
- Classes: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary

## Visualizations
- Training/Validation Curves
- Sample Classifications
- Confusion Matrix
- Sample Activation Steps

## Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Install requirements
3. Run Jupyter Notebook
